const GLOSSARY: Record<string, { term: string; definition: string; howToUse: string }> = {
    "P/E (TTM)": {
        term: "Price-to-Earnings Ratio (Trailing Twelve Months)",
        definition: "How much investors pay for every 1 unit of earnings. Calculated as: Share Price ÷ Earnings Per Share (last 12 months).",
        howToUse: "Lower P/E generally means cheaper. A P/E of 8–12 is often considered undervalued; 20–30+ may indicate premium or growth pricing. Compare within the same sector.",
    },
    "Forward P/E": {
        term: "Forward Price-to-Earnings",
        definition: "Same as P/E but uses next year's estimated earnings instead of past earnings. Forward P/E reflects expected future profitability.",
        howToUse: "If Forward P/E < trailing P/E, earnings are expected to grow. A lower Forward P/E than peers suggests a more attractive entry point.",
    },
    "EV / EBITDA": {
        term: "Enterprise Value to EBITDA",
        definition: "Compares total company value (market cap + debt - cash) to operating cash earnings (EBITDA). More reliable than P/E for capital-heavy companies.",
        howToUse: "Under 10x is generally cheap; 15–20x+ can indicate premium. Use to compare companies with different debt structures.",
    },
    "Price / Book": {
        term: "Price-to-Book Ratio",
        definition: "Compares market value per share to book value (net assets) per share. A P/B of 1 means you're paying exactly what the company's assets are worth.",
        howToUse: "P/B below 1 may indicate undervaluation or asset-heavy business trading at discount. High P/B signals investor confidence in future growth.",
    },
    "Gross Margin": {
        term: "Gross Profit Margin",
        definition: "Percentage of revenue remaining after subtracting cost of goods sold (COGS). Formula: (Revenue - COGS) ÷ Revenue × 100.",
        howToUse: "Higher is better. Above 40% is excellent for most sectors. Falling gross margin signals pricing pressure or rising input costs.",
    },
    "Operating Margin": {
        term: "Operating Profit Margin",
        definition: "Percentage of revenue remaining after all operating expenses (salaries, rent, depreciation) but before interest and taxes.",
        howToUse: "Above 15% is strong. Consistent or rising operating margin signals good cost control and scalable business model.",
    },
    "Net Profit Margin": {
        term: "Net Profit Margin",
        definition: "Bottom-line profitability: percentage of revenue that becomes net income after ALL expenses, taxes, and interest.",
        howToUse: "Higher is better. Compare to industry peers. Negative margin means the company is losing money on each sale.",
    },
    "Return on Equity": {
        term: "Return on Equity (ROE)",
        definition: "Measures how efficiently management generates profit from shareholders' equity. Formula: Net Income ÷ Shareholders' Equity × 100.",
        howToUse: "Above 15% is considered good; above 20% is excellent. A consistently high ROE indicates a competitive moat and efficient management.",
    },
    "EPS (TTM)": {
        term: "Earnings Per Share (Trailing Twelve Months)",
        definition: "Total net profit divided by total shares outstanding. Represents the company's profit on a per-share basis.",
        howToUse: "Rising EPS over time signals profitable growth. Compare against peers and the stock's historical EPS trend.",
    },
    "Beta (vs Market)": {
        term: "Beta",
        definition: "Measures a stock's price volatility relative to the broader market. Beta of 1 = moves with market; Beta > 1 = more volatile; Beta < 1 = less volatile.",
        howToUse: "High beta (>1.5) stocks offer higher potential returns but greater risk. Low beta (<0.8) stocks are safer but may underperform in bull markets.",
    },
    "Debt / Equity": {
        term: "Debt-to-Equity Ratio",
        definition: "Total debt divided by shareholders' equity. Shows how much debt the company uses to finance its assets relative to equity.",
        howToUse: "Below 50% is generally safe; above 150% signals high leverage risk. Rising D/E in a rising rate environment is dangerous.",
    },
    "Book Value / Share": {
        term: "Book Value Per Share",
        definition: "Net asset value of the company divided by shares outstanding. Represents what shareholders would theoretically receive if the company was liquidated.",
        howToUse: "If current price is close to or below book value, the stock may be undervalued. Compare P/B ratio with this figure.",
    },
    "Quick Ratio": {
        term: "Quick Ratio (Acid Test)",
        definition: "Measures ability to pay short-term obligations using liquid assets only (cash + receivables). Excludes inventory. Formula: (Cash + Receivables) ÷ Current Liabilities.",
        howToUse: "Above 1 is healthy (can cover short-term debt). Below 0.5 may signal liquidity stress. Better than current ratio for volatile inventory businesses.",
    },
    "Current Ratio": {
        term: "Current Ratio",
        definition: "Measures short-term liquidity: Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities. Shows ability to pay bills due within 12 months.",
        howToUse: "Above 1.5 is comfortable; below 1 means more short-term debt than assets — potential cash crunch signal.",
    },
    "Dividend Yield": {
        term: "Dividend Yield",
        definition: "Annual dividends paid per share as a percentage of the stock price. Formula: Annual Dividend ÷ Share Price × 100.",
        howToUse: "Higher yield = more income. But very high yields (above 8–10%) may signal a dividend cut risk. Check payout ratio and earnings stability.",
    },
    "Market Cap": {
        term: "Market Capitalization",
        definition: "Total market value of all outstanding shares. Formula: Share Price × Total Shares Outstanding.",
        howToUse: "Large cap (>10B): stable, lower risk. Mid cap (2–10B): growth potential. Small cap (<2B): higher growth potential but higher risk.",
    },
    "52-Week High": {
        term: "52-Week High Price",
        definition: "The highest price the stock has traded at in the past 52 weeks (one year).",

    },
    "52-Week Low": {
        term: "52-Week Low Price",
        definition: "The lowest price the stock has traded at in the past 52 weeks.",
        howToUse: "A price near the 52-week low can signal a bargain — or a fundamentally troubled company. Always investigate the reason behind the drop.",
    },
    "50-Day Moving Avg": {
        term: "50-Day Moving Average",
        definition: "Average of the last 50 trading days' closing prices. A widely watched short-to-medium term trend indicator.",
        howToUse: "Price above 50-DMA = short-term uptrend. Price crossing above 50-DMA from below = bullish signal. Crossing below = bearish signal.",
    },
    "200-Day Moving Avg": {
        term: "200-Day Moving Average",
        definition: "Average of the last 200 trading days' closing prices. The most important long-term trend indicator.",
        howToUse: "'Golden Cross' (50-DMA crossing above 200-DMA) = strong buy signal. 'Death Cross' (50-DMA below 200-DMA) = bearish long-term signal.",

        term: "Today's Trading Range",
        definition: "The lowest and highest price at which the stock traded during the current trading day.",
        howToUse: "A narrow day range suggests low volatility. A wide range signals high activity. Current price near day high shows bullish momentum; near day low shows selling pressure.",
    },
    "Volume": {
        term: "Trading Volume",
        definition: "Number of shares traded during a given period (usually the current day or average daily).",
        howToUse: "High volume on price increase = strong conviction buy signal. High volume on price drop = strong sell signal. Low volume moves are less reliable.",
    },
    "Upside Potential": {
        term: "Upside Potential (Expected Return)",
        definition: "Percentage gain expected from current price to the analyst target price. Formula: (Target Price - Current Price) ÷ Current Price × 100.",
        howToUse: "Positive upside = BUY signal. Negative = overvalued vs analyst consensus. Higher upside with high analyst conviction is a strong signal.",

        definition: "A price level where selling pressure historically prevents the price from rising further.",
        howToUse: "If current price is approaching resistance, the stock may stall or pull back. A breakout above resistance is a strong bullish signal.",
